What is your COVID-19 web app name?
COVID-19 Awareness and Guidance

What is your motivation?
My motivation is to bring life to my imaginations when making something, I always want to bring new things/functions
when doing something so I always think of a way to do it. I created functions in my website
such as it allows you to save a registered user in the members list and used it to login and also used the Admin login
which is the user is adminuser and the password is adminpass. everytime you click login, a tab will be either removed or changed
to make it look like you really did login for example from Login, it will change into your NAME, the same as ADMIN and it will
remove the tabs that you dont need.

bootstrapper
css
javascript (the same as my motivation and thx to w3schools and stackoverflow):
-working registration/login page
-changes content everytime you click a tab/menu
-allows you to register and the user will be saved in the member list (can add and register many).
-directly send you to login page and it allows registered accounts to login.
-directly sends you to home page and changes the login tab to your first name and last name in uppercase and hides the registration tab.
-automatically logs out and login again when you click your name in the Account Menu.
-allows you to login Admin acc using the username: adminuser and password: adminpass
-directly sends you to home page and hides the login tab and registration tab and changes the admin tab to my name.
-allows you to click the images in the footer and directly sends you to my pages.
